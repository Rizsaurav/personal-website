# Building a Scalable Blogging Site: Is Hardcoding Easier for Developers?

When you're starting out building your personal website or portfolio, adding a blog might seem straightforward. You write a few paragraphs in JSX, maybe even just toss a few \`<p>\` tags in a component, slap it onto a route, and you're done. But what happens when you're 10 posts deep? 50 posts? Want to add tags? Filter posts? Add commenting, reactions, or dynamic slugs?

This post walks you through **how I migrated my developer blog from hardcoded pages to a scalable Markdown + React system** with Firebase-based commenting, and why doing it right matters for long-term growth.

## 🧱 Why Not Just Hardcode?

Let’s be real — hardcoding is fast and feels good at first. Here's how I started:

- Every blog post was its own React component under \`pages/blogs/\`
- Each had its own route manually registered in \`App.jsx\` or \`router.jsx\`
- I styled content manually using Tailwind or CSS modules

For a couple of posts, this is fine. But once I crossed 5–6 posts, problems started piling up:

- I had to **manually copy boilerplate code** for each new blog post
- There was **no separation of content and code** — my blog content was buried in JSX
- I couldn’t easily **filter or list posts by tag/date**
- I had no simple way to **generate dynamic slugs or titles**
- Content updates required **re-deploying the whole site**

That’s when I realized — this wasn’t sustainable.

## 💡 Solution: Markdown + Frontmatter + React Router

Instead of coding every post, I switched to writing each blog in a \`.md\` file.

Each Markdown file had a **frontmatter header** like this:

\`\`\`\`\`\`md
---
title: My First Blog Post
date: 2025-07-22
author: Saurav Rijal
tags: [react, markdown, dev]
authorImage: /images/authors/saurav.jpg
---

This allowed me to keep content clean, structured, and version-controlled, while still having full freedom 
over layout and rendering.

I used a library like marked to convert the markdown body into HTML and then safely render it in React using dangerouslySetInnerHTML.

📁 Project Structure for Scale
Here’s the high-level folder structure I use:

/src
  /app
    /blogs
      index.jsx         // Blog listing
      [slug].jsx        // Dynamic blog post
  /lib
    /posts              // All .md files stored here
    utils.js            // For parsing frontmatter + body
Instead of hardcoding every route, I built a dynamic router that reads all .md files at build time, 
parses their slugs, and renders the correct post.

🔖 Creating Slugs from Filenames
Each Markdown file is stored under /src/lib/posts/ and named like this:

my-first-blog.\`\`\`md
how-i-fixed-my-react-app.\`\`\`md
scaling-your-design-system.\`\`\`md
We parse slugs from filenames by stripping the .md extension.

\`\`\`js
export function getAllSlugs() {
  const files = import.meta.glob('/src/lib/posts/*.md', { as: 'raw', eager: true });
  return Object.entries(files).map(([path, content]) => {
    const slug = path.split('/').pop().replace('.md', '');
    return { slug, content };
  });
}
Each blog route looks like:

/blogs/my-first-blog
/blogs/how-i-fixed-my-react-app
That’s clean, SEO-friendly, and intuitive.

🔍 Parsing Frontmatter with Regex
I used a custom utility to extract frontmatter (YAML) and markdown body:

\`\`\`js
function parseFrontMatter(mdContent) {
  const match = /^---\\n([\\s\\S]+?)\\n---/.exec(mdContent);
  if (!match) return { attributes: {}, body: mdContent };

  const rawAttributes = match[1];
  const attributes = {};
  rawAttributes.split('\\n').forEach(line => {
    const [key, ...rest] = line.split(':');
    attributes[key.trim()] = rest.join(':').trim();
  });

  const body = mdContent.slice(match[0].length);
  return { attributes, body };
}
This approach lets me use .md files like mini blog CMS entries without needing an actual CMS yet.

🧠 Why This Is Scalable
Let’s break down why this setup works long-term.

✅ 1. Separation of Concerns
Blog content lives in Markdown

Blog display lives in React

Layout is reusable across posts

This reduces duplication and lets non-developers (or future me) edit content easily.

✅ 2. Easier Maintenance
Want to update an author name or fix a typo? Just open the .md file.

Want to change how all blog posts are styled? Just update the BlogPost.jsx layout file.

✅ 3. Rich Metadata
Thanks to frontmatter, I can now:

Display author image/name

Filter posts by tag

Sort by date

Generate preview cards

✅ 4. Scalable Routing
The [slug].jsx file in React handles any blog route dynamically.

\`\`\`jsx
import { useParams } from "react-router-dom";
import { getAllSlugs, parseFrontMatter } from "../../lib/utils";

export default function BlogPost() {
  const { slug } = useParams();
  const post = getAllSlugs().find(p => p.slug === slug);
  const { attributes, body } = parseFrontMatter(post.content);

  return (
    <article>
      <h1>{attributes.title}</h1>
      <div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: marked(body) }} />
    </article>
  );
}
This means no more adding routes for new posts — the slug handles it.

💬 Adding Comments with Firebase
I wanted people to engage with my blog. Instead of using Disqus or embedding something external, 
I built my own commenting system using Firebase Firestore.

Features:
Google or anonymous sign-in

Authenticated comment posting

Threaded replies

Per-comment reactions (❤️ 👍 💡 ⭐)

Real-time updates (thanks to Firestore listeners)

🔥 Reactions — The Right Way
Every user can react to a comment with only one reaction at a time. 
Reacting again replaces the previous one.

\`\`\`js
userReactions: {
  uid1: "heart",
  uid2: "thumb",
  uid3: "star"
}
We calculate counts by mapping over the userReactions values.

Only authenticated users can delete their own comments — not others. 
This keeps things clean, secure, and friendly.

🧪 Real-Time Firestore Listeners
I use onSnapshot to listen to comment changes in real-time:

\`\`\`js
useEffect(() => {
  const q = query(collection(db, "comments"), orderBy("timestamp", "desc"));
  return onSnapshot(q, snap => {
    setComments(snap.docs.map(d => ({ id: d.id, ...d.data() })));
  });
}, []);
This means users can see new comments, edits, or replies instantly, without refreshing.

🪄 How It Feels Now
Adding a new blog post is as easy as:

Creating a new .md file

Writing content with frontmatter

Saving and pushing to GitHub

The system automatically:

Parses metadata

Generates a slug

Renders layout

Shows on the homepage

Supports comments out-of-the-box

No rebuilds, no manual routing, no repeated code.

🔮 The CMS Question
Eventually, if my site grows or others want to contribute, I can plug in a CMS like:

Netlify CMS

Contentful

Sanity

For now, though, Markdown keeps everything version-controlled, fast, and developer-friendly.

🧰 Tools I Used
React + Vite

React Router DOM

Firebase Auth & Firestore

Tailwind CSS

marked for parsing markdown

Regex for frontmatter

Custom hooks for comments and slugs

📈 Future Upgrades
Here’s where I plan to go next:

Add pagination and infinite scroll

Integrate Firestore likes into blog analytics

Let users bookmark blog posts

Add reading time estimates

Dark mode for reader comfort

🧵 Final Thoughts: Is Hardcoding Easier?
Yes, hardcoding is easier — but only at first.

If you’re building something small that won’t grow, go ahead and hardcode. But if you care about:

Growth

Maintainability

Clean content-authoring

Feature expansion

Then investing in Markdown + dynamic slugs + proper architecture is absolutely worth it.

This small change made my site more flexible, future-proof, and fun to build.

📣 If you’re a dev reading this — go build your own markdown-powered blog. You’ll learn about parsing, slugs, dynamic routes, real-time Firebase, and scalable design patterns. It’s worth it.
